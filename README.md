# BARcSharp
A tool to extract the BWAV files from Switch .bars files (for AMTA v5 only, particularly found in a game Animal Crossing New Horizons)

Just my "casual" take on a tool development, inspired from this tool: https://github.com/jackz314/bars-to-bwav

Although the tool itself may be far from perfect, it should be able to extract most Switch .bars files
